V 0.5.x Notes

<<<<<<< HEAD
Note a new setting wil be created in the ipsec_connections db called 'PreviousState' by the script

=======
** Note that nothing is guaranteed to work and it may break your system or deny you access **

Also note that on occasion ipsec can get hung - I think this is when you enable/disable a few times quite quickly and the connection is still waiting on a timeout



Various refinements and bug fixes.

Note a new setting will be created in the ipsec_connections db called 'PreviousState'
>>>>>>> smeserver-libreswan-0.5
This tracks changes made so ipsec-update knows what to do on state changes. There is no need to touch this setting

Additional db entries

Set mtu as in Config or ipsec connections if required

Add rsasigs

set
security rsasig
certname "Your cert nickname" - find with  'certutil -d . -L |grep u,u,u'

https://libreswan.org/man/ipsec.conf.5.html

ike = Some examples are ike=3des-sha1,aes-sha1, ike=aes, ike=aes128-md5;modp2048, ike=aes128-sha1;dh22, ike=3des-md5;modp1024,aes-sha1;modp1536 or ike=modp1536
phase2alg = aes-sha1 | similar to above

Note there is no DB entry for phase2 - Libreswan defaults to ESP so unless you use AH (not recommended) leave as is

----------------------------------------------------------

[root@test ipsec.d]# config show ipsec
ipsec=service
    UDPPort=500
    access=public
    auto=add
    connectiontype=tunnel
    dpdaction=restart
    dpddelay=30
    dpdtimeout=10

    left=%defaultroute
    pfs=yes
    salifetime=28800s
    security=secret
    status=enabled



Any setting in the db ipsec_connections will override the default settings in the config db (or should !) If there is no setting the system will set a default.

There is now a new action script called ipsec-update.

Make your changes and then signal-event ipsec-update to action them.

Note that as it is very difficult currently to detect connections that are up (something libreswan are working on) the script does not try to detect connection status so it will reset them currently.

Just discovered we can probably do this with ipsec whack --status |grep "Ipsec SA established" (Only tells if it is up, not if it is active)

Any question then please add a bug here or ask at forums.contribs.org in the Contribs sections.

Notes to self on Firewalls

<<<<<<< HEAD
Set access public/private - we need this for some firewall original rules to allow port 500 and now to enable rules for ESP on IP 50
=======
IPSec (VPN tunneling) uses the following ports:

50 - Encapsulation Header (ESP)
51 - Authentication Header (AH)
500/udp - Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
4500/udp - NAT traversal

L2TPD
1701 (L2TP)


>>>>>>> smeserver-libreswan-0.5

the rp_filter and send redirects are directly manipulated by the ipsec-update script

We could possibly set the firewall ports in the main config db and dispense with the masq fragment later.
<<<<<<< HEAD
[Done]
=======
[11/2015 Done for ipsec - just need a postrouting config]
>>>>>>> smeserver-libreswan-0.5

http://wiki.contribs.org/DB_Variables_Configuration#IPTables_firewall_.28masq.29

ipsec only - note that ESP traffic runs on 50 and AH needs 51
